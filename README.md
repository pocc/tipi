**WIP. This is not guaranteed to do anything!** 

Trivial IPython Integrations (for my workflow). 

The plan is to control your computer with IPython. Things like opening a
webbrowser, returning one google result, updating tasks through a 
CLIish interface. bash provides a suboptimal API and I think it
should be possible to use IPython integrations to provide a better one.
